<h1>Chrome-Theme - Minimal Blue</h1>
Complete With Multi-Language Support, HD-Icon And In-Additional, A Manifest Filled With Complete-Attributes From The Chrome-Source-Code.

#A dictionary-code [example].

including variations of:
- minimal-blue:  <strong>THE MINIMAL ONE</strong> - `frame` and `frame_inactive` attributes only, old-school Chrome blue (nice if you use that new Gray Chrome builds) --- very rendering efficient.
- minimal-black: no color attributes at all seems to be, that, perfect black-coal/carbon/charcoal Chrome theme- easy!
- manifest-attribute-complete: taking all the attributes available from Chromium code, just nice to have ready at hand..

the default `manifest.json` is minimal-blue :]

<hr/>

To Use This:
 
 _0. clone the repository anywhere (for example: `C:\www\Chrome-Theme-Basic`)._
 
 1.  open Chrome.
 2.  navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
 3.  check-ON the "developer-mode" checkbox.
 4.  click the "pack an extension" button.
 5.  on the "base folder" put the required path to the cloned-repository (for example: `C:\www\Chrome-Theme-Basic`).
 6.  leave "private" line empty.
 7.  click "pack".
 8.  browse your computer to the parent-folder of the cloned-repository (for example: `C:\www\`).
 9.  drag and drop your `CRX` file on to the `chrome://extensions/` page, answer "yes" to install.
 10. done.
 
 You can restore the default theme back, by using the "themes-reset" button at `chrome://settings/`

<hr/>

this must be done since `CRX`, although basically `ZIP` format (for extension), is required to some have unique data (very strict for themes since Chrome's themes-engine is ancient and hasn't been update since 2012),
packing a CRX with Chrome adds those stuff in.. :/

note that the black minimal theme has no active/inactive difference, but you may add it :]

You may download the (working) `CRX` files from the binary folder <sub>(drag&amp;drop over the extensions tab as explained above)</sub>
